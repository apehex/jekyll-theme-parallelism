# Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

To test the theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using the theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test the theme's contents. As you make modifications to the theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When the theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git are be bundled.
To add a custom directory to the theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `jekyll-theme-parallelism.gemspec` accordingly.

It's done! Parallelism was an idea I mocked up a few months ago but, due to other
committments, didn't get around to putting to code until recently. Different to
my more general-purpose freebies, this one's specifically built for portfolio use
with a very unique look/layout. Hope you enjoy it!

Demo images* are courtesy of the supremely talented photographer Felicia Simion.
If you like photography or just enjoy being blown away by awesome stuff, check
