# Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

To test the theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using the theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test the theme's contents. As you make modifications to the theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When the theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git are be bundled.
To add a custom directory to the theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `jekyll-theme-twenty.gemspec` accordingly.

This is Twenty, a minimal, multi-page responsive site template for HTML5 UP.

As the name implies, this is my twentieth (!) design for HTML5 UP. Since the last
few have been single page affairs, I decided to go with something a bit more conventional
and threw in four extra page layouts. Beyond that, it's the usual drill: fully responsive,
built on HTML5/CSS3, and CCA licensed like all my other stuff. Sass sources are also
included for those of you into that sort of thing (entirely optional).

Special thanks to Michael Domaradzki (md.photomerchant.net) for allowing me to use
his excellent photos in Twenty's demo*.
